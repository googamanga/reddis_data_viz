&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been playing the same game of Civ II for 10 years. Though long outdated, I grew fascinated with this particular game because by the time Civ III was released, I was already well into the distant future. I then thought that it might be interesting to see just how far into the future I could get and see what the ramifications would be. Naturally I play other games and have a life, but I often return to this game when I&amp;#39;m not doing anything and carry on. The results are as follows. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world is a hellish nightmare of suffering and devastation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are 3 remaining super nations in the year 3991 A.D, each competing for the scant resources left on the planet after dozens of nuclear wars have rendered vast swaths of the world uninhabitable wastelands. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The ice caps have melted over 20 times (somehow) due primarily to the many nuclear wars. As a result, every inch of land in the world that isn&amp;#39;t a mountain is inundated swamp land, useless to farming. Most of which is irradiated anyway. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-As a result, big cities are a thing of the distant past. Roughly 90% of the worlds population (at it&amp;#39;s peak 2000 years ago) has died either from nuclear annihilation or famine caused by the global warming that has left absolutely zero arable land to farm. Engineers (late game worker units) are always busy continuously building roads so that new armies can reach the front lines. Roads that are destroyed the very next turn when the enemy goes. So there isn&amp;#39;t any time to clear swamps or clean up the nuclear fallout. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Only 3 super massive nations are left. The Celts (me), The Vikings, And the Americans. Between the three of us, we have conquered all the other nations that have ever existed and assimilated them into our respective empires. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-You&amp;#39;ve heard of the 100 year war? Try the 1700 year war. The three remaining nations have been locked in an eternal death struggle for almost 2000 years. Peace seems to be impossible. Every time a cease fire is signed, the Vikings will surprise attack me or the Americans the very next turn, often with nuclear weapons. Even when the U.N forces a peace treaty. So I can only assume that peace will come only when they&amp;#39;re wiped out. It is this that perpetuates the war ad infinitum. Have any of you old Civ II players out there ever had this problem in the post-late game?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-Because of SDI, ICBMS are usually only used against armies outside of cities. Instead, cities are constantly attacked by spies who plant nuclear devices which then detonate (something I greatly miss from later civ games). Usually the down side to this is that every nation in the world declares war on you. But this is already the case so its no longer a deterrent to anyone. My self included.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The only governments left are two theocracies and myself, a communist state. I wanted to stay a democracy, but the Senate would always over-rule me when I wanted to declare war before the Vikings did. This would delay my attack and render my turn and often my plans useless. And of course the Vikings would then break the cease fire like clockwork the very next turn. Something I also miss in later civ games is a little internal politics. Anyway, I was forced to do away with democracy roughly a thousand years ago because it was endangering my empire. But of course the people hate me now and every few years since then, there are massive guerrilla (late game barbarians) uprisings in the heart of my empire that I have to deal with which saps resources from the war effort.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-The military stalemate is air tight. The post-late game in civ II is perfectly balanced because all remaining nations already have all the technologies so there is no advantage. And there are so many units at once on the map that you could lose 20 tank units and not have your lines dented because you have a constant stream moving to the front. This also means that cities are not only tiny towns full of starving people, but that you can never improve the city. &amp;quot;So you want a granary so you can eat? Sorry; I have to build another tank instead. Maybe next time.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-My goal for the next few years is to try and end the war and thus use the engineers to clear swamps and fallout so that farming may resume. I want to rebuild the world. But I&amp;#39;m not sure how. If any of you old Civ II players have any advice, I&amp;#39;m listening.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Uncharted games are personally my favorite series of games, with Uncharted 2 and 3 being my favorite games of all time. They&amp;#39;re certainly the most cinematic games I&amp;#39;ve ever played. I&amp;#39;ve often heard many people describe these games as like controlling a movie, and have heard many people say that these games are just as fun to watch as they are to play, and I agree with both of those things. That gave me the idea to edit these games into movies. That way I would be able to watch the story of these games in one sitting easily, and without having to take up a considerable portion of my day. Not only that, but I would be able to show these to people who either don&amp;#39;t have a PS3, don&amp;#39;t have or want these games but still are interested in seeing the story, or even don&amp;#39;t play video games at all. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these projects I was trying to make movies that would be viewable whether or not you had played the game, or even care about playing video games, so I wanted to make them as close to a real movie as possible. This meant taking out as many chapter titles, button prompts, and more to make it seem less like a video game. There were certain aspects I wasn&amp;#39;t able to remove, such as the current weapon selected, or an occasional button prompt. I tried to focus mostly on the cinematics, but also include the minimum amount of gameplay to link them, especially focusing on the more cinematic elements of gameplay. I wanted to make sure not to cut any cutscenes or any gameplay that would leave the viewer confused if they hadn&amp;#39;t played the game, so in the end Uncharted 2 and 3 were quite long, but that&amp;#39;s just because the stories are much more complicated than Uncharted 1&amp;#39;s. Either way it&amp;#39;s still a lot shorter than playing the real game, so if you are ever in the mood to watch the story of one of these games in one sitting, but don&amp;#39;t have the time to play the entire game through, then these are great for that purpose, or if you want to show these games&amp;#39; stories to friends or family that don&amp;#39;t care about playing video games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me know what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!&lt;/p&gt;
