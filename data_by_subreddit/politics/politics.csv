&lt;p&gt;Source:
&amp;quot;Go Daddy has a long history of supporting federal legislation directed toward combating illegal conduct on the Internet. For example, our company strongly supported the Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, the Protect Our Children Act of 2008, and the Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act of 2011 (PROTECT IP).  Go Daddy has always supported both government and private industry efforts to identify and disable all types of illegal activity on the Internet.  It is for these reasons that I’m still struggling with why some Internet companies oppose PROTECT IP and SOPA.  There is no question that we need these added tools to counteract illegal foreign sites that are falling outside the jurisdiction of U.S. law enforcement.  And there is clearly more that we could all be doing to adequately address the problems that exist.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Public Option health care system. (&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WHO%27s_ranking_of_health_care_systems""&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reducing the power of filibuster by restoring it to its original place in Senate procedure, requiring simple majorities to pass laws. (&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filibuster#U.S._Filibuster_History""&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eschew professional politicians in favor of politically knowledgeable  citizens interested in political positions. (&lt;a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cato_the_Elder""&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

The &lt;strong&gt;bill currently has 235 co-sponsors&lt;/strong&gt;- 153 Democrats and 82 Republicans.  A bill &lt;strong&gt;needs 218 votes for passage&lt;/strong&gt; by the House of Representatives.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This bill had enough support and co-sponsors to PASS had it finished going through the process and gone to voting, but Eric Cantor prevented any voting to occur by indefinitely postponing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This should be front page. How are we allowing him to override the majority of congress? Blockading the democratic process. We should be absolutely outraged at this. This should be the headline across all media. Of all places, REDDIT is the place to make this news. We did it for PIPA/SOPA. Let&amp;#39;s do it again!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;UPDATE (7:35pm est):&lt;/strong&gt; A few people have brought up Eric Cantor&amp;#39;s explanation of why he postponed it and asked I link it here. I think that is fair, as we should always be willing to look at all sides of a story: &lt;a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57344486-503544/cantor-plans-to-revive-stock-act-in-early-2012/""&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-57344486-503544/cantor-plans-to-revive-stock-act-in-early-2012/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His talk is good in this interview, but as we all know from our experience with politics, talk means nothing without action. He promises it&amp;#39;ll come back in the first couple months of 2012. We&amp;#39;re now 1 month in and have no date scheduled for this. The most important thing in all of this is that we ensure this bill, and other important bills, don&amp;#39;t get ignored and dropped. Congress has to serve the people. Not self-interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated to STOCK, but a recent &lt;a href=""http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=7393500n""&gt;CBS interview with Cantor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It is causing us to waffel on the issue at hand. If you have nothing to add to the conversation then please don&amp;#39;t post so we can see those individuals that are spinning the conversation.

&lt;p&gt;CISPA could allow any private company to share vast amounts of sensitive, private data about its customers with the government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISPA would override all other federal and state privacy laws, and allow a private company to share nearly anything—from the contents of private emails and Internet browsing history to medical, educational and financial records—as long as it “directly pertains to” a “cyber threat,” which is broadly defined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISPA does not require that data shared with the government be stripped of unnecessary personally-identifiable information. A private company may choose to anonymize the data it shares with the government. However, there is no requirement that it does so—even when personally-identifiable information is unnecessary for cybersecurity measures. For example, emails could be shared with the full names of their authors and recipients. A company could decide to leave the names of its customers in the data it shares with the government merely because it does not want to incur the expense of deleting them. This is contrary to the recommendations of the House Republican Cybersecurity Task Force and other bills to authorize information sharing, which require companies to make a reasonable effort to minimize the sharing of personally-identifiable information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISPA would allow the government to use collected private information for reasons other than cybersecurity. The government could use any information it receives for “any lawful purpose” besides “regulatory purposes,” so long as the same use can also be justified by cybersecurity or the protection of national security. This would provide no meaningful limit—a government official could easily create a connection to “national security” to justify nearly any type of investigation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISPA would give Internet Service Providers free rein to monitor the private communications and activities of users on their networks. ISPs would have wide latitude to do anything that can be construed as part of a “cybersecurity system,” regardless of any other privacy or telecommunications law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISPA would empower the military and the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect information about domestic Internet users. Other information sharing bills would direct private information from domestic sources to civilian agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security. CISPA contains no such limitation. Instead, the Department of Defense and the NSA could solicit and receive information directly from American companies, about users and systems inside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CISPA places too much faith in private companies, to safeguard their most sensitive customer data from government intrusion. While information sharing would be voluntary under CISPA, the government has a variety of ways to pressure private companies to share large volumes of customer information. With complete legal immunity, private companies have few clear incentives to resist such pressure. There is also no requirement that companies ever tell their customers what they have shared with the government, either before or after the fact. As informed consumers, Americans expect technology companies to have clear privacy policies, telling us exactly how and when the company will use and share our personal data, so that we can make informed choices about which companies have earned our trust and deserve our business.&lt;/p&gt;

I felt this comment needed it's own thread. I took it from this guy. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/tb/spnsi)

Reddit we need to understand that we are an open community which means there are people posting in these threads that are paid to spin the conversation away from the real issue. It is causing us to waffel on the issue at hand. If you have nothing to add to the conversation then please don't post so we can see those individuals that are spinning the conversation. Otherwise do everything you can activist wise to help our cause. No cynics, pessimists, detractors please. 

CISPA could allow any private company to share vast amounts of sensitive, private data about its customers with the government.

CISPA would override all other federal and state privacy laws, and allow a private company to share nearly anything—from the contents of private emails and Internet browsing history to medical, educational and financial records—as long as it “directly pertains to” a “cyber threat,” which is broadly defined.

CISPA does not require that data shared with the government be stripped of unnecessary personally-identifiable information. A private company may choose to anonymize the data it shares with the government. However, there is no requirement that it does so—even when personally-identifiable information is unnecessary for cybersecurity measures. For example, emails could be shared with the full names of their authors and recipients. A company could decide to leave the names of its customers in the data it shares with the government merely because it does not want to incur the expense of deleting them. This is contrary to the recommendations of the House Republican Cybersecurity Task Force and other bills to authorize information sharing, which require companies to make a reasonable effort to minimize the sharing of personally-identifiable information.

CISPA would allow the government to use collected private information for reasons other than cybersecurity. The government could use any information it receives for “any lawful purpose” besides “regulatory purposes,” so long as the same use can also be justified by cybersecurity or the protection of national security. This would provide no meaningful limit—a government official could easily create a connection to “national security” to justify nearly any type of investigation.

CISPA would give Internet Service Providers free rein to monitor the private communications and activities of users on their networks. ISPs would have wide latitude to do anything that can be construed as part of a “cybersecurity system,” regardless of any other privacy or telecommunications law.

CISPA would empower the military and the National Security Agency (NSA) to collect information about domestic Internet users. Other information sharing bills would direct private information from domestic sources to civilian agencies, such as the Department of Homeland Security. CISPA contains no such limitation. Instead, the Department of Defense and the NSA could solicit and receive information directly from American companies, about users and systems inside the United States.

CISPA places too much faith in private companies, to safeguard their most sensitive customer data from government intrusion. While information sharing would be voluntary under CISPA, the government has a variety of ways to pressure private companies to share large volumes of customer information. With complete legal immunity, private companies have few clear incentives to resist such pressure. There is also no requirement that companies ever tell their customers what they have shared with the government, either before or after the fact. As informed consumers, Americans expect technology companies to have clear privacy policies, telling us exactly how and when the company will use and share our personal data, so that we can make informed choices about which companies have earned our trust and deserve our business.

&lt;p&gt;Seriously. polos and khakis. Every time you guys DO finally get some fucking press, it&amp;#39;s a scrawny dude with dreads in a ratty t-shirt. You&amp;#39;re going big here, dress it. Tomorrow, Polo shirt and Khakis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why? Because you need to get the right-leaning equivalent of me on your side. I&amp;#39;m 35 right now. I understand where the hippy thing comes from. I get it as well as a guy who&amp;#39;s 35 can. My Counterparts do not. They think you are scummy druggies on welfare and when they see on tv a bunch of people who they think are S.D&amp;#39;s on W, they root for the cops to hit you again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of the cops, Who do you think they&amp;#39;ll mace first? SD&amp;#39;s on W, or a guy in khakis and a polo? Seriously, it&amp;#39;s fucking cop camouflage. And if they DO come for you. When people at home see** PEOPLE THAT LOOK LIKE THEM** getting abused by police... That&amp;#39;s when shit changes. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Seeing protesters get beat up means nothing because protesters get beat up all the time. Therefore, don&amp;#39;t look like a protester! This connects you to the person watching and opens them to your side!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for serious. Do it. You&amp;#39;re almost about to tip this thing over. Polos and khakis. Cop Camo + target audience = Shave, shower and polos and khakis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Polo shirt and Khakis = dress code for nyc protests tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Going to bed soon, one more thing before I turn it over to all of you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please spread this as much as you can. Professionalism will help push this thing over the edge. You have labor pushing you. National Media is starting to wake up to you. You&amp;#39;re almost there. Keep pushing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Think: Business Casual Friday. Don&amp;#39;t play it up like the Billionaires for healthcare. You&amp;#39;re just a guy, going to work in this big office building here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if you don&amp;#39;t think that you SHOULD be judged on appearances (which I do agree), You have to realize that you ARE. Fight the appearance fight another day. Polos and khakis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ninety-one people including doctors, nurses and other medical professionals were charged criminally after an investigation of Medicare fraud that involved $430 million in false billing in seven cities, officials said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was the government’s second big raid in recent months after a similar investigation in May involving $452 million in possible fraud in Medicare, the health program for the elderly and disabled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accusations include billing the government for unnecessary ambulance rides in California, writing prescriptions for patients in Dallas who did not qualify for them and paying kickbacks like food and cigarettes to patients in Houston if they attended programs for which a hospital could bill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The investigation is part of an effort by the Obama administration to find health care savings.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arrests were made in Houston, Dallas, Brooklyn, Baton Rouge, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami. The largest crackdown occurred in South Florida where 33 people were rounded up and charged in connection with health care fraud cases totaling more than $230 million. In Texas, the president of Riverside General Hospital in Houston and his son were also charged.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius added that new provisions in President Barack Obama&amp;#39;s Affordable Care Act made it more difficult for fraud to be committed.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This fraud sweep is the latest in a series of raids conducted since 2007 by the strike force. Over the past five years 1,480 suspects have been arrested in Medicare fraud cases totaling $4.8 billion dollars.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Romney went way, way out of his way to go after PBS in his debate. Yet, as uber-liberal rag Forbes Magazine notes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For fiscal year 2010, federal funding for PBS through CPB accounted for about 12% of PBS’ revenue. In terms of dollars, that works out to about $300 million. There’s not much wiggle room to be had: the money that actually goes to CPB is split according to a mostly statutory formula. For 2015, Congress has budgeted $445 million for CPB. That’s less than 1% of the budget. Way less. It’s about 1/100th of a 1%.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not disparaging cutting waste: cutting waste is good. But with a deficit as large as the current one, if you’re going to focus on cuts, we should focus on real cuts. By the numbers, cutting funding for PBS won’t save the budget. Not by a long shot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the goal is for voters to get lost in sophistry and talking points spin, then Team Romney has done well. But when it comes to producing ACTUAL results, the $4.8 billion in fraud the Obama administration has cracked down on is FAR more impressive than the fear-mongering that Romney is doing over borrowing &amp;quot;money from China &amp;quot; in order to keep PBS going. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","Our friends in D.C. are telling us that the Senate vote on S.2105, the Obama-backed bill that contains the CISPA language, is going to happen as soon as they get back from Memorial Day recess. CISPA, in case you've forgotten, is the bill that would nullify all existing privacy laws and give corporations legal immunity for sharing your communications with the government. It would effectively end privacy on the internet.

Today is our last chance to call and request meetings with our senators' staffs before they go into recess mode. These 99 senators need more calls (took Wyden off the list because he is [amazing](http://www.wyden.senate.gov/news/blog/post/wyden-on-cyber-security-privacy-should-be-the-default-not-the-exception)). Can you call your senators and politely ask to meet with them or their staff about CISPA over the Memorial Day recess? Let us know how it goes in the comments.

&lt;p&gt;The College Republicans, a student club at Fordham University, has invited Ann Coulter to speak on campus on November 29. The event is funded through student activity fees and is not open to the public nor the media. Student groups are allowed, and encouraged, to invite speakers who represent diverse, and sometimes unpopular, points of view, in keeping with the canons of academic freedom. Accordingly, the University will not block the College Republicans from hosting their speaker of choice on campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To say that I am disappointed with the judgment and maturity of the College Republicans, however, would be a tremendous understatement. There are many people who can speak to the conservative point of view with integrity and conviction, but Ms. Coulter is not among them. Her rhetoric is often hateful and needlessly provocative—more heat than light—and her message is aimed squarely at the darker side of our nature.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As members of a Jesuit institution, we are called upon to deal with one another with civility and compassion, not to sling mud and impugn the motives of those with whom we disagree or to engage in racial or social stereotyping. In the wake of several bias incidents last spring, I told the University community that I hold out great contempt for anyone who would intentionally inflict pain on another human being because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or creed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Disgust”was the word I used to sum up my feelings about those incidents. Hate speech, name-calling, and incivility are completely at odds with the Jesuit ideals that have always guided and animated Fordham.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, to prohibit Ms. Coulter from speaking at Fordham would be to do greater violence to the academy, and to the Jesuit tradition of fearless and robust engagement. Preventing Ms. Coulter from speaking would counter one wrong with another. The old saw goes that the answer to bad speech is more speech. This is especially true at a university, and I fully expect our students, faculty, alumni, parents, and staff to voice their opposition, civilly and respectfully, and forcefully.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The College Republicans have unwittingly provided Fordham with a test of its character: do we abandon our ideals in the face of repugnant speech and seek to stifle Ms. Coulter’s (and the student organizers’) opinions, or do we use her appearance as an opportunity to prove that our ideas are better and our faith in the academy—and one another—stronger? We have chosen the latter course, confident in our community, and in the power of decency and reason to overcome hatred and prejudice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joseph M. McShane, S.J., President&lt;/p&gt;

As members of a Jesuit institution, we are called upon to deal with one another with civility and compassion, not to sling mud and impugn the motives of those with whom we disagree or to engage in racial or social stereotyping. In the wake of several bias incidents last spring, I told the University community that I hold out great contempt for anyone who would intentionally inflict pain on another human being because of their race, gender, sexual orientation, or creed.

“Disgust”was the word I used to sum up my feelings about those incidents. Hate speech, name-calling, and incivility are completely at odds with the Jesuit ideals that have always guided and animated Fordham.

Still, to prohibit Ms. Coulter from speaking at Fordham would be to do greater violence to the academy, and to the Jesuit tradition of fearless and robust engagement. Preventing Ms. Coulter from speaking would counter one wrong with another. The old saw goes that the answer to bad speech is more speech. This is especially true at a university, and I fully expect our students, faculty, alumni, parents, and staff to voice their opposition, civilly and respectfully, and forcefully.

The College Republicans have unwittingly provided Fordham with a test of its character: do we abandon our ideals in the face of repugnant speech and seek to stifle Ms. Coulter’s (and the student organizers’) opinions, or do we use her appearance as an opportunity to prove that our ideas are better and our faith in the academy—and one another—stronger? We have chosen the latter course, confident in our community, and in the power of decency and reason to overcome hatred and prejudice.

We understand that you are a corporation, and you have your own interests. However, I strongly suggest that Reddit Inc. takes a serious stance against CISPA. If there isn&amp;#39;t a movement by the corporation, then it will be done by the people. Two ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I propose removing Reddit from our AdBlock exceptions list on May 1&lt;sup&gt;st.&lt;/sup&gt; This will continue until Reddit Inc. decides to join us in opposing Cispa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week long boycott going through May 14 until May 21. Seven days of redditors not using Reddit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If they join us on or before May 14&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; we will not need to do the boycott. If they join &lt;em&gt;any time&lt;/em&gt; after May 14, then the boycott needs to continue as planned. It will not be very convincing if we just wuss out three days into a demonstration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, what do you think? Do you like the idea? Will you actually do it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Changed the date to May 14 so that &lt;a href=""/r/FIA""&gt;/r/FIA&lt;/a&gt; will not endangered by the blackout. My bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 5: Okay, a lot of people are leaving messages about how we need to hit the politicians. I couldn&amp;#39;t agree more, but I also accept the fact that this is less likely. If we could get some people to send letters, and make phone calls to their representatives it would be much more effective at mitigating future bills that negatively affect us.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Serious&lt;/strong&gt; Edit: Alright, so there are a lot of people who will (not surprisingly) refuse to leave reddit for a week. Since this seems to be so intolerable, I&amp;#39;ve gotten an interesting suggestion.  For the days that we have our protest/boycott people should make accounts with something such as: ANTICISPA_PROTEST_xxx (where the x&amp;#39;s are for a random number, so you can all make these accounts)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No use of your normal username, just the protesting one. This will keep Reddit informed about our dissatisfaction with their stance on CISPA, and also allow people to take a bigger advantage of our tier-style boycott (No use for the serious boycott, only ANTICISPA accounts for the people who still want to make an impact). Can I get some feedback?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To the administrators&lt;/strong&gt; I am making a request for &lt;em&gt;two&lt;/em&gt; things:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the admins &amp;#39;absolutely cannot, under any circumstance&amp;#39; blackout the site then have them write an incredibly detailed blog post, much like they did about PIPA/SOPA, so that users can be informed, motivated, and encouraged to take action on their own. Using the blog post to effectively spread the word across the entire site will show the users just how much of an impact CISPA has on all American internet users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have the admins explicitly state that while CISPA does not really affect reddit INC all that much, it does dramatically eliminate many safeguards for user privacy and expectations of anonymity. Have them explain that while they cannot black out the site that they are using their voice, as best they can, to explain to users that they need to advocate for themselves and how they can do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to SwampySoccerField for this great idea in communicating with the admins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not trying to make this an anti-Reddit campaign. You allow us to communicate very effectively, and we thoroughly enjoy using your site. I know that we can come to an agreement. But, &lt;strong&gt;please&lt;/strong&gt;, show us that you are listening. Show us that you are trying to do &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; that can benefit (hopefully with some good, politically motivated action) everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SUNDAY EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; Again, thank you so much. You guys have been awesome. &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/sxdxv/a_quick_note_on_cispa_and_related_bills/c4hs04e""&gt;Link&lt;/a&gt; to the administrator&amp;#39;s response. Thank you for responding to us and starting to really help us out here. Let&amp;#39;s not think that this thing is over, it is only the beginning. &lt;a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/syif5/redditors_its_time_to_take_action_four_bills_are/""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a link to the start of our movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monday Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; No response from Reddit Inc. AdBlock is on. I hope to hear from some of you that you&amp;#39;ve started to protest alongside me. Still looking for a better solution, but haven&amp;#39;t been getting a lot of response. I was thinking that we could push the idea of using throwaway accounts with ANTICISPA in the name closer to May 7. Maybe if Reddit sees some outcry, they&amp;#39;ll actually want to take a stance before we abandon the site for a week. Keep up the good fight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Final Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Sorry about the delay. I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of things going on, so I wasn&amp;#39;t able to log in late last night. This will be my last post/comment/anything on Reddit until the 21st. I hope all of you were serious when you said you&amp;#39;d join me. For those of you who simply can &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; resist Reddit, I ask that you kindly stop using your normal account. Make one called CISPA_PROTEST_2220222 and post/comment/vote with that. You guys have been great. I&amp;#39;ll see you all in a week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","Reddit Inc. has obviously not been as gung-ho about stopping CISPA as it was about SOPA. No big deal.

I am not trying to make this an anti-Reddit campaign. You allow us to communicate very effectively, and we thoroughly enjoy using your site. I know that we can come to an agreement. But, **please**, show us that you are listening. Show us that you are trying to do *something* that can benefit (hopefully with some good, politically motivated action) everyone.

**SUNDAY EDIT:** Again, thank you so much. You guys have been awesome. [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/sxdxv/a_quick_note_on_cispa_and_related_bills/c4hs04e) to the administrator's response. Thank you for responding to us and starting to really help us out here. Let's not think that this thing is over, it is only the beginning. [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/syif5/redditors_its_time_to_take_action_four_bills_are/) is a link to the start of our movement.

**Monday Edit:** No response from Reddit Inc. AdBlock is on. I hope to hear from some of you that you've started to protest alongside me. Still looking for a better solution, but haven't been getting a lot of response. I was thinking that we could push the idea of using throwaway accounts with ANTICISPA in the name closer to May 7. Maybe if Reddit sees some outcry, they'll actually want to take a stance before we abandon the site for a week. Keep up the good fight.

**Final Edit:** Sorry about the delay. I've had a lot of things going on, so I wasn't able to log in late last night. This will be my last post/comment/anything on Reddit until the 21st. I hope all of you were serious when you said you'd join me. For those of you who simply can *not* resist Reddit, I ask that you kindly stop using your normal account. Make one called CISPA_PROTEST_2220222 and post/comment/vote with that. You guys have been great.

&lt;p&gt;INTERNETS, 18th of January 2012.
PRESS RELEASE, FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over a century ago Thomas Edison got the patent for a device which would &amp;quot;do for the eye what the phonograph does for
the ear&amp;quot;. He called it the Kinetoscope. He was not only amongst the first to record video, he was also the first person
to own the copyright to a motion picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of Edisons patents for the motion pictures it was close to financially impossible to create motion pictures
in the North american east coast. The movie studios therefor relocated to California, and founded what we today call
Hollywood. The reason was mostly because there was no patent.
There was also no copyright to speak of, so the studios could copy old stories and make movies out of them - like
Fantasia, one of Disneys biggest hits ever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the whole basis of this industry, that today is screaming about losing control over immaterial rights, is that they
circumvented immaterial rights. They copied (or put in their terminology: &amp;quot;stole&amp;quot;) other peoples creative works,
without paying for it. They did it in order to make a huge profit. Today, they&amp;#39;re all successful and most of the
studios are on the Fortune 500 list of the richest companies in the world. Congratulations - it&amp;#39;s all based on being
able to re-use other peoples creative works. And today they hold the rights to what other people create.
If you want to get something released, you have to abide to their rules. The ones they created after circumventing
other peoples rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reason they are always complainting about &amp;quot;pirates&amp;quot; today is simple. We&amp;#39;ve done what they did. We circumvented the
rules they created and created our own. We crushed their monopoly by giving people something more efficient. We allow
people to have direct communication between eachother, circumventing the profitable middle man, that in some cases take
over 107% of the profits (yes, you pay to work for them).
It&amp;#39;s all based on the fact that we&amp;#39;re competition.
We&amp;#39;ve proven that their existance in their current form is no longer needed. We&amp;#39;re just better than they are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the funny part is that our rules are very similar to the founding ideas of the USA. We fight for freedom of speech.
We see all people as equal. We believe that the public, not the elite, should rule the nation. We believe that laws
should be created to serve the public, not the rich corporations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Pirate Bay is truly an international community. The team is spread all over the globe - but we&amp;#39;ve stayed out of the
USA. We have Swedish roots and a swedish friend said this:
The word SOPA means &amp;quot;trash&amp;quot; in Swedish. The word PIPA means &amp;quot;a pipe&amp;quot; in Swedish. This is of course not a coincidence.
They want to make the internet inte a one way pipe, with them at the top, shoving trash through the pipe down to the
rest of us obedient consumers. 
The public opinion on this matter is clear. Ask anyone on the street and you&amp;#39;ll learn that noone wants to be fed with
trash. Why the US government want the american people to be fed with trash is beyond our imagination but we hope that
you will stop them, before we all drown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOPA can&amp;#39;t do anything to stop TPB. Worst case we&amp;#39;ll change top level domain from our current .org to one of the
hundreds of other names that we already also use. In countries where TPB is blocked, China and Saudi Arabia springs to
mind, they block hundreds of our domain names. And did it work? Not really.
To fix the &amp;quot;problem of piracy&amp;quot; one should go to the source of the problem. The entertainment industry say they&amp;#39;re
creating &amp;quot;culture&amp;quot; but what they really do is stuff like selling overpriced plushy dolls and making 11 year old girls
become anorexic. Either from working in the factories that creates the dolls for basically no salary or by watching
movies and tv shows that make them think that they&amp;#39;re fat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the great Sid Meiers computer game Civilization you can build Wonders of the world. One of the most powerful ones
is Hollywood. With that you control all culture and media in the world. Rupert Murdoch was happy with MySpace and had
no problems with their own piracy until it failed. Now he&amp;#39;s complainting that Google is the biggest source of piracy
in the world - because he&amp;#39;s jealous. He wants to retain his mind control over people and clearly you&amp;#39;d get a more
honest view of things on Wikipedia and Google than on Fox News.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some facts (years, dates) are probably wrong in this press release. The reason is that we can&amp;#39;t access this information
when Wikipedia is blacked out. Because of pressure from our failing competitors. We&amp;#39;re sorry for that.&lt;/p&gt;

INTERNETS, 18th of January 2012.
PRESS RELEASE, FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.

Over a century ago Thomas Edison got the patent for a device which would ""do for the eye what the phonograph does for

There was also no copyright to speak of, so the studios could copy old stories and make movies out of them - like

So, the whole basis of this industry, that today is screaming about losing control over immaterial rights, is that they
circumvented immaterial rights. They copied (or put in their terminology: ""stole"") other peoples creative works,
without paying for it. They did it in order to make a huge profit. Today, they're all successful and most of the
studios are on the Fortune 500 list of the richest companies in the world. Congratulations - it's all based on being
able to re-use other peoples creative works. And today they hold the rights to what other people create.
If you want to get something released, you have to abide to their rules. The ones they created after circumventing
other peoples rules.

The reason they are always complainting about ""pirates"" today is simple. We've done what they did. We circumvented the
rules they created and created our own. We crushed their monopoly by giving people something more efficient. We allow

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people have made posts asking or hoping that we can come to conclusions or something.  I can&amp;#39;t say this represents everyone here, but I will add one idea I that is sticking with me personally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We demand a law, or First Amendment clarification (thats the bit that says we have the right to assemble to petition our government), that not only makes it legal to protest en masse, but dictates that during a non-violent protest, certain laws, such as curfew, blocking traffic or causing noise disturbances can be overlooked.  The logic is this: our laws are in place to protect the citizens.  But if a large enough group of the citizens are peacefully breaking a law to make a protest about a bigger point, then the Police protecting them directly should be more important than protecting them indirectly, by enforcing the minor law bring broken.&lt;/p&gt;
