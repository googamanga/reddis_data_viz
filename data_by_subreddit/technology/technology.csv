&lt;p&gt;*EDIT 2&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am by no means an authority on how a newsroom works.
I will say that I have NEVER once seen corporate influence in the journalist efforts in the pursuit of a story.
I cannot speak for the inner workings of The FOX News Network. 
I will say it is common for a Newsroom to have regulations and procedures on certain content that hits the air.
(Ex. Said newsroom may decide not to cover deadly shootings or dead bodies. Some may decide that crime stories take precedence over human interest and consumer fraud.)
 This all falls into the stations marketing strategy of how they want to appeal to their audience (often 25-54yr olds)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, car commercials keep the lights on in your local TV station. Good journalism and interesting stories are going to keep you watching. If it&amp;#39;s good enough it gets filtered up to the big boys.
 If you think for a minute that a some suit and tie executive could walk up to Brian Williams and tell him not to cover a story of importance because it doesn&amp;#39;t align with their company&amp;#39;s agenda than you are crazy.
  These journalists are of the highest caliber. Your local weatherman might have a cocaine addiction (cough cough... Charlotte) But when you play with the big boys you better know your shit. Stories with the most interest on a stations website will only fuel our need to do more with it. 
Headlines sell... Interest sells... We investigate fraud and corruption and seek out the truth but if it doesn&amp;#39;t sell than Lindsay Lohan&amp;#39;s boobs will. Keep pressing your media outlets. You would be so surprised how a bull-shit story in dumbfuck Okahoma can be a headline the next day. Love and kisses!!!!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;","I've worked in television newsrooms for years. I know the in's and out's of many broadcasts.
You want action Reddit? You want people to talk? Contact the Media...*Call* and *Write* their
* phone lines
* emails
* blogs
* social networks

Make it so every newsroom producer has NO choice but to make mention of the evil **Sopa** would bring. Flood their communication channels so bad, that the fact it's happening becomes the story! State your case in your message and give them something to work with. First and foremost news needs a story to be told. Assignment editors and News directors will send reporters to localize stories. 
(ex.WHY INTERNET ENTHUSIASTS EVERYWHERE WANT TO WASH CLEAN THE SOPA)

Here are just a few links to get started with- that WILL get noticed. Most anchors and reporters you see on tv do have facebook and twitter and they DO find and write stories themselves. Also, should anyone contact Alison Kosik or Robin Meade, tell them I personally would like to say I love you.
